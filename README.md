VolunteerForce is a full-stack CRUD (all 7 RESTful routes) app meant to simulate a simplistic logistics system for a volunteer medical foundation. However Doctors Across Borders and its relief efforts are a work of fiction. Names, characters, businesses, places, events and incidents are either the products of this fledging coderâ€™s imagination or used in a fictitious manner. Any resemblance to actual persons (living or dead), products, or actual events is purely coincidental. 
 
 The technologies used however are not fictious and include: 
 Node.js
 Mongoose, 
 MongoDB,
 Express,
 EJS,
 Bootstrap
 Mongo
 Robo 3T (formerly known as robomongo)
 
 Beyond the routes, this app does aggregate across the documents to sort location data. 
 The app design was documented with Google Docs.
